### basically try to build what a Financial Planner would do

Ideas for myself or Mom:
* wealthfront vs Schwab?
* 401k vs Roth? how much each?
* house renovations? turf? solar?
* investment property?
* how much cash should I have? emergency supply.
* how much do I spend?
  * what are the easiest things to save on?
  * what would happen if I did? how much impact?
* best savings?
* buy home vs invest?
* sell home? keep? sell 1 home? 
* rent out home and rent?
* other things to invest in?
